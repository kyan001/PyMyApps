## Translation Rules
1. Any romaji from kana is followed by a space char.
2. Space before ")" is removed and a space char is added after it.
3. Katakanas(片仮名) -- such like あいうえお -- become lowercases. Hiraganas(平仮名) -- such like アイウエオ -- become UPPERCASEs.
4. Youons(拗音) -- such like りょ -- are translated before others.
5. Characters other than kanas are not touched.
